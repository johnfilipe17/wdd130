        <p class="main-para">Hey guys, my name is João and I'm from Brazil. I've had the privilege to marry in the temple to a great woman and we don't have any kids yet. I live on the coast , very close to the beach, it is hot and sunny.</p>
        <p> I have been a member of the church my whole life and I had the opportunitty to serve a mission in the atlanta north mission. </p>
        <p>I love learning and I am new to web developing but I am enjoying so far. I really want to get my bachelor's degree. I really want to make the difference in my community.</p>
        <p>I love playing and watching soccer. I like working out and outdoor exercises in general, however, I really enjoy staying home and I am looking forward to knowing and working with you guys.</p>
