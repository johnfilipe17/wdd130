    <h1>What is açai</h1>
    <p>Açaí na tigela ("açaí in the bowl") is a northern Brazilian dessert, Native people used to prepare it regularly. It is a dish made with the frozen and mashed fruit of the açaí palm, which has berries described as having an "earthy" or creamy taste. Its texture and taste are really appealing. It is served as a smoothie in a bowl or glass, and is commonly topped with powdered milk and banana, and then mixed with other fruits and guaraná syrup.  </p>
