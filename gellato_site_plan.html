        What is açai
Açaí na tigela ("açaí in the bowl") is a northern Brazilian dessert, Native people used to prepare it regularly. It is a dish made with the frozen and mashed fruit of the açaí palm, which has berries described as having an "earthy" or creamy taste. Its texture and taste are really appealing. It is served as a smoothie in a bowl or glass, and is commonly topped with powdered milk and banana, and then mixed with other fruits and guaraná syrup.

Although açaí na tigela is commonly consumed all over Brazil.it has become more regionalized mainly in Pará, Rio de Janeiro, Florianópolis, São Paulo, Goiás and along the northeastern coast, where it is sold in kiosks lining the beach promenade and in juice bars throughout the cities. Preparation is different from region to region. Tapioca pearls are a common topping in northern Brazil. The original recipe contains shrimp or fried fish and tapioca or farofa, and is usually savoury. It is common to see açaí served with fish and cassava. The sweet variety, which contains granola, banana, blueberry, strawberry, goji berry, and other fruits, as well as sugar, is more common in southern parts of the country.

        About us
Our company and website were created as a source of information on our wonderful and nutritious Brazilian dessert. Our main objective is to share a tasty and significant part of our culture.We have identified some aspects of our culture (Brazilian and North American) that can be really similar. One of these aspects is the love for candies in general. The weather is another aspect observed. Brazilian weather is mostly sunny and warm the most part of the year. American weather varies in lot, depending on where you live, however, almost without exceptions, it will get sunny and hot eventually and you will look for a frozen dessert to refresh you. That is when we come to place.
