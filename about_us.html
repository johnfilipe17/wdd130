    <h1>About us</h1>
    <p>Our company and website were created as a source of information on our wonderful and nutritious Brazilian dessert. Our main objective is to share a tasty and significant part of our culture.We have identified some aspects of our culture (Brazilian and North American) that can be really similar. One of these aspects is the love for candies in general. The weather is another aspect observed. Brazilian weather is mostly sunny and warm the most part of the year. American weather varies in lot, depending on where you live, however, almost without exceptions, it will get sunny and hot eventually and you will look for a frozen dessert to refresh you. That is when we come to place.</p>

    <h2>Getting safe information</h2>
    <p>Our low prices and high quality has helped us to enter into the North American region with much strength. Our website is designed to provide safe and valid information to our public. When it comes to food, especially those we will share with our loved ones, there’s no room for doubt or misinformation.  </p>
